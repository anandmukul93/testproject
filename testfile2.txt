this is another text file to check the uncommited changes remains but how can we switch the branches 
commiting it to the new_branch at first 
then making change again and try to switch to master without commiting this change

i cannot switch to another branch  if i have uncommmited changes  on this branch (to already tracked files)
then i can either 
	scrap changes and switch 
	commite changes and switch 
	stash changes and switch
